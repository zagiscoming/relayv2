Set up a hermes relayer
In current example we will learn how to set up IBC relayer between two cosmos chains

Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
Install dependencies
sudo apt install unzip -y
Make hermes home dir
cd $HOME
mkdir -p $HOME/.hermes/bin
Download Hermes
verison="v0.15.0"
wget "https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/releases/download/$verison/hermes-$verison-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz"
tar -C $HOME/.hermes/bin/ -vxzf hermes-$verison-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
rm hermes-$verison-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
echo "export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.hermes/bin" >> $HOME/.bash_profile
source $HOME/.bash_profile
 
Setup hermes config
Set up variables
All settings below are just example for IBC Relayer between stride STRIDE-TESTNET-2 and juno GAIA testnets. Please fill with your own values.

Chain-1
MEMO='zuka#5870' #add your discord username here
CH1_RPC='127.0.0.1' #add the IP of your first node
CH1_RPC_PORT='26657' #add RPC port of your first node
CH1_GRPC_PORT='9090' #add gRPC port of your first node
CH1_CHAIN_ID='STRIDE-TESTNET-2' #add chainID of youe first node
CH1_ACC_PREFIX='stride' #add account prefix
CH1_DENOM='ustrd' #add denom
CH1_TRUST='10h 29m' #add trusting period. Must be less than unbond time
CH1_REL_WALLET='CH1_REL_WALLET'
Chain-2
You don't need to change anything if you don't have a gaia installed (my node is used here)

CH2_RPC='78.107.234.44' #add the IP of your second node
CH2_RPC_PORT='36657' #add RPC port of your second node
CH2_GRPC_PORT='9797' #add gRPC port of your second node
CH2_CHAIN_ID='GAIA' #add ChainID of your second node
CH2_ACC_PREFIX='cosmos' #add account prefix
CH2_DENOM='uatom' #add denom
CH2_TRUST='10h 29m' #add trusting period. Must be less than unbond time
CH2_REL_WALLET='CH2_REL_WALLET'
Save vars (copy paste ALL LINES at once)

Verify hermes configuration is correct
Before proceeding further please check if your configuration is correct

hermes health-check
Healthy output should look like:

2022-07-21T19:38:15.571398Z  INFO ThreadId(01) using default configuration from '/root/.hermes/config.toml'
2022-07-21T19:38:15.573884Z  INFO ThreadId(01) [STRIDE-TESTNET-2] performing health check...
2022-07-21T19:38:15.614273Z  INFO ThreadId(01) chain is healthy chain=STRIDE-TESTNET-2

2022-07-21T19:38:15.627747Z  INFO ThreadId(01) chain is healthy chain=GAIA
Success: performed health check for all chains in the config
Recover wallets using mnemonic phrase
Before you proceed with this step, please make sure you have created and funded with tokens seperate wallets on each chain! Replace <insert mnemonic here> with the mnemonic from your wallet

hermes keys restore $CH1_CHAIN_ID -n $CH1_REL_WALLET -m "<insert mnemonics here>"
hermes keys restore $CH2_CHAIN_ID -n $CH2_REL_WALLET -m  "<insert mnemonics here>"
Successful output should look like:

2022-07-21T19:54:13.778550Z  INFO ThreadId(01) using default configuration from '/root/.hermes/config.toml'
Success: Restored key 'wallet' (stride19u539q85fun7nax92w853gcqtl74kr0evd65cl) on chain STRIDE-TESTNET-2
2022-07-21T19:54:14.956171Z  INFO ThreadId(01) using default configuration from '/root/.hermes/config.toml'

Create hermes service file
(copy and paste into the terminal with one command)

sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/hermesd.service > /dev/null <<EOF

Start service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable hermesd
sudo systemctl restart hermesd && journalctl -u hermesd -f
Successfull logs should look like this:
